## Time series anomaly detection for total volume of traffic

'Identifies anamalous spikes in network traffic logs as compared to baseline or normal historical patterns.
The query leverages a KQL built-in anomaly detection algorithm to find large deviations from baseline patterns.
Sudden increases in network traffic volume may be an indication of data exfiltration attempts and should be investigated.
The higher the score, the further it is from the baseline value.
The output is aggregated to provide summary view of unique source IP to destination IP address and port traffic observed in the flagged anomaly hour.
The source IP addresses which were sending less than percentotalthreshold of the total traffic have been exluded whose value can be adjusted as needed .
You may have to run queries for individual source IP addresses from SourceIPlist to determine if anything looks suspicious'

## Time series anomaly detection for total volume of traffic

'Identifies anamalous spikes in network traffic logs as compared to baseline or normal historical patterns.
The query leverages a KQL built-in anomaly detection algorithm to find large deviations from baseline patterns.
Sudden increases in network traffic volume may be an indication of data exfiltration attempts and should be investigated.
The higher the score, the further it is from the baseline value.
The output is aggregated to provide summary view of unique source IP to destination IP address and port traffic observed in the flagged anomaly hour.
The source IP addresses which were sending less than percentotalthreshold of the total traffic have been exluded whose value can be adjusted as needed .
You may have to run queries for individual source IP addresses from SourceIPlist to determine if anything looks suspicious'

## Time series anomaly detection for total volume of traffic

'Identifies anamalous spikes in network traffic logs as compared to baseline or normal historical patterns.
The query leverages a KQL built-in anomaly detection algorithm to find large deviations from baseline patterns.
Sudden increases in network traffic volume may be an indication of data exfiltration attempts and should be investigated.
The higher the score, the further it is from the baseline value.
The output is aggregated to provide summary view of unique source IP to destination IP address and port traffic observed in the flagged anomaly hour.
The source IP addresses which were sending less than percentotalthreshold of the total traffic have been exluded whose value can be adjusted as needed .
You may have to run queries for individual source IP addresses from SourceIPlist to determine if anything looks suspicious'

## Azure storage key enumeration

'Listing of storage keys is an interesting operation in Azure which might expose additional 
secrets and PII to callers as well as granting access to VMs. While there are many benign operations of this
type, it would be interesting to see if the account performing this activity or the source IP address from 
which it is being done is anomalous. 
The query below generates known clusters of ip address per caller, notice that users which only had single
operations do not appear in this list as we cannot learn from it their normal activity (only based on a single
event). The activities for listing storage account keys is correlated with this learned

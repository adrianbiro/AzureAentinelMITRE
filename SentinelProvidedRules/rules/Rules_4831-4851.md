# Rules: 4831-4851

## DNS - domain anomalous lookup increase

'Checking for a threefold increase or more of domain lookups per client IP address for the current day vs daily average for the previous week.
This can potentially identify excessive traffic to a given location that could be indicative of data transfer out of your network to a group of systems based on the same second level domain.
For example, if one client is sending requests for test1.badguy.com and another client is sending requests for test2.badguy.com, you may not see a high enough count to be interesting.
However, a combination of the requests to badguy.com could have a high enough count to be interesting.
This is only Name lookups, so it would be recommended to review the Firewall\Webproxy logs in relation to the client IP address making the interesting requests.'

## DNS - domain anomalous lookup increase

'Checking for a threefold increase or more of domain lookups per client IP address for the current day vs daily average for the previous week.
This can potentially identify excessive traffic to a given location that could be indicative of data transfer out of your network to a group of systems based on the same second level domain.
For example, if one client is sending requests for test1.badguy.com and another client is sending requests for test2.badguy.com, you may not see a high enough count to be interesting.
However, a combination of the requests to badguy.com could have a high enough count to be interesting.
This is only Name lookups, so it would be recommended to review the Firewall\Webproxy logs in relation to the client IP address making the interesting requests.'

## recon-with-rundll

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Trickbot: Pervasive & underestimated.
Trickbot is a very prevalent piece of malware with an array of malicious capabilities. Originally designed to steal banking credentials, it has since evolved into a modular trojan that can deploy other malware, disable security software, and perform command and control (C2) operations.
Trickbot operators are known to use the legitimate Windows process rundll.exe to perform malicious activities, such as reconnaissance. Once a target is infected, the operator will drop a batch file that runs several commands and connects to a C2 server for further action.
The following query detects suspicious rundll.exe activity associated with Trickbot campaigns.
See Office applications launching wscript.exe to run JScript for another query related to Trickbot activity.

## check-for-shadowhammer-activity-download-domain

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, ShadowHammer supply chain attack
Operation ShadowHammer was an attack against ASUS computer hardware, using the company's own update infrastructure to deliver malware to the company's products. The campaign ran from June to November, 2018. ASUS has since responded with updates that protect their Live Update system, and diagnostic tools to check affected systems.
The following query checks for activity associated with the ShadowHammer download domain over the past 30 days.

## c2-bluekeep

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Exploitation of CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep).
CVE-2019-0708, also known as BlueKeep, is a critical remote code execution vulnerability involving RDP. Soon after its disclosure, the NSA issued a rare advisory about this vulnerability, out of concern that it could be used to quickly spread malware. Attackers have since used this vulnerability to install cryptocurrency miners on targets.
Microsoft has issued updates for this vulnerability, as well as guidance for protecting operating systems that we no longer support. Microsoft Defender ATP also contains behavioral detections for defending against this threat.
The following query locates devices that have communicated with attacker infrastructure associated with BlueKeep-related cryptomining.

## Connection to Rare DNS Hosts

This query will break down hostnames into their second and third level domain parts and analyze the volume of connections made to the destination to look for low count entries. Note that this query is likely to be rather noisy in many organziations and may benefit from analysis over time, anomaly detection, or perhaps machine learning.

## python-use-by-ransomware-macos

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, EvilQuest signals the rise of Mac ransomware.
As of the time of this writing (October 2020), ransomware designed to target macOS is relatively rare. EvilQuest is one of the few examples of this kind of malware on the platform.
The query below can help locate an attempt to run Python in service of malicious activity by a remote operator. The command the query searches for is associated with, but not definitely indicative of, EvilQuest infections.

## EncodedDomainURL [Nobelium]

Looks for a logon domain in the Azure AD logs,  encoded with the same DGA encoding used in the Nobelium campaign.
See Important steps for customers to protect themselves from recent nation-state cyberattacks for more on the Nobelium campaign (formerly known as Solorigate).
This query is inspired by an Azure Sentinel detection.

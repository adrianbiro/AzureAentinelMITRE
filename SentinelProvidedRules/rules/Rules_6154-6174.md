## Check for multiple signs of ransomware activity

Instead of running several queries separately, you can also use a comprehensive query that checks for multiple signs of ransomware activity to identify affected devices. The following consolidated query:
Looks for both relatively concrete and subtle signs of ransomware activity
Weighs the presence of these signs
Identifies devices with a higher chance of being targets of ransomware
When run, this consolidated query returns a list of devices that have exhibited multiple signs of attack. The count of each type of ransomware activity is also shown.

## Private Key Files

Private Key Files.
This query identifies file operation with files having.
One of the extensions commonly used to save a private.
Key.  The risk is that if an attacker were to obtain.
The file, they could brute force any password on it.
And potentially obtain a powerful certificate.  To do.
This, they would only need to obtain read access to.
The file.
The risk associated with these files is heavily.
Determined by the value of the certificate.  For example,.
Loss of a self-signed certificate created by Adobe Acrobat.
Is significantly less impactful than loss of a website.
SSL certificate.
Recommendation: Know where these files are, and if possible.
Back them up and remove them.  You might also consider.
Creating an informational alert.

## wadhrama-credential-dump

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, RDP ransomware persists as Wadhrama.
The ransomware known as Wadhrama has been used in human-operated attacks that follow a particular pattern. The attackers often use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain initial access to a device or network, exfiltrate credentials, and maintain persistance.
The following query checks for possible Wadhrama-related activity, by detecting the technique these attackers have used in the past to dump credentials.
Other techniques used by the group associated with Wadhrama are listed under See also.

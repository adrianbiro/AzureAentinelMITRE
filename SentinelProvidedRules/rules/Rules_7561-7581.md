## Machine info from IP address

The following queries pivot from an IP address assigned to a machine to the relevant machine or logged-on users.
To read more about it, check out this post: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/What-s-New/Advanced-hunting-now-includes-network-adapters-information/m-p/224402#M74.
Query #1: get machines that have used a given local IP address at a given time - as configured on their network adapters.

## Firewall Policy Design Assistant

This query helps you design client firewall rules based on data stored within DeviceNetworkEvents. Folder paths are alias'ed to help represent the
files making or receiving network connections without dealing with duplication from path variance due to different root drive letter or user profile
association.
To make the report easy to read, inbound remote IP addresses are not calculated by default (this can be changed by setting the value of IncludeInboundRemoteIPs to true).
Also, the ephemeral range is defaulted to 49152 to help eliminate false detections.

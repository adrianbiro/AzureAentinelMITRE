## Suspicious Data Access to S3 Bucket from Unknown IP

'Adversaries may access data objects from improperly secured cloud storage. This query will identify any access originating from a Source IP which was not seen historically accessing the bucket or downloading files from it.
You can also limit the query to only private buckets with sensitive files by setting the value or list of values to BucketName column.

## S3 Bucket outbound Data transfer anomaly

'Identifies when an anomalous spike occur in data transfer from an S3 bucket based on GetObject API call and the BytesTransferredOut field.
The query leverages KQL built-in anomaly detection algorithms to find large deviations from baseline patterns.
Sudden increases in execution frequency of sensitive actions should be further investigated for malicious activity.
Manually change scorethreshold from 1.5 to 3 or higher to reduce the noise based on outliers flagged from the query criteria.

## Azure DevOps - Build Check Deleted.

'Build checks can be built into a pipeline in order control the release process, these can include things such as the successful passing of certain steps, or an explicit user approval. An attacker who has altered a build process may look to remove a check in order to ensure a compromised build is released. This hunting query simply looks for all check removal events,  these should be relatively uncommon. In the output Type shows the type of Check that was deleted. '

## Azure DevOps - Variable Created and Deleted

'Variables can be used at various stages of a pipeline to inject static variables. Depending on the build process these variables could be added by an attacker to get a build process to conduct an unwanted action such as communicating with an attacker-controlled endpoint or injecting values into code. This query looks for variables that are added and then deleted in a short space of time. This is not normal expected behavior and could ben an indicator of attacker creating elements and then covering tracks. If this hunting query produces only a small number of events in an environment it could be promoted to a detection.'

## Azure DevOps - New Release Approver

'Releases in Azure Pipelines often require a user authorization to perform the release. An attacker that has compromised a build may look to self-approve a release using a compromised account to avoid user focus on that release. This query looks for release approvers in pipelines where they have not approved a release in the last 30 days. This query can have a significant false positive rate so its best suited as a hunting query rather than a detection.'
